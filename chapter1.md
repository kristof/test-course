`@instructions`
Do you still remember the difference between an argument with 
and without default values? Have another look at the `sd()` function 
by typing `?sd` in the console. The usage section shows the following 
information:

`@hint`
- The `if` statement can start as `if (print_info)`. Because `print_info` 
is already a logical, you don't need a relational operator.
- Use `paste()` inside `print()`:
```
print(paste(x, "to the power two equals", y))
```

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{undefined}
# Finish the pow_two() function
pow_two <- function(x) {
  y <- x ^ 2
  print(paste(x, "to the power two equals", y))
  return(y)
}
```
